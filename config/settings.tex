      In today’s digital age, the quality of a camera lens significantly impacts photographic and videographic outcomes. This thesis develops an open-source, user-friendly Python application for assessing lens quality using printable test charts and commonly available equipment. The application captures and processes images to evaluate lens properties such as sharpness, vignetting, point spread function (PSF), and bokeh. It provides performance scores, ensuring consistent results across different camera models and lighting conditions, offering an accessible, cost-effective tool for photographers.
