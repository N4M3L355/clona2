The tests were designed to validate both the technical functionality and the practical usability of the application.

\subsection{Test Architecture}
The test suite is organized into four main components, reflecting the modular architecture of the application:

    """Test camera initialization"""
    with patch('gphoto2.Camera') as mock_camera_class:
        mock_camera_class.return_value = mock_camera
        mock_camera_class.autodetect = MagicMock(
            return_value=[(0, "Test Camera")])
        
        # Mock camera status check
        config = MagicMock()
        widget = MagicMock()
        widget.get_value.return_value = 0
        config.get_child_by_name.return_value = widget
        mock_camera.get_config.return_value = config
        
        manager = CameraManager()
        success = manager.initialize_camera()
        
        assert success

    capture_result = {
        'path': os.path.join(temp_dir, "test.jpg"),
        'metadata': {
            'camera_settings': {
                'aperture': '1.8',
                'shutterspeed': '1/100',
                'iso': '400'
            }
        }
    }
    
    ui_instance.camera_manager.capture_image = MagicMock(
        return_value=capture_result)
    ui_instance.camera_manager.connected = True
    
    with patch('nicegui.ui.notify') as mock_notify:
        ui_instance.handle_capture_photo()
        ui_instance.camera_manager.capture_image\
