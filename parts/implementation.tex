\subsection{Dependencies}
This project relies on Python programming language and on several Python libraries and tools:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{gphoto2}: Core library for camera communication and control
    \item \textbf{OpenCV}: Image processing and analysis capabilities
    \item \textbf{NumPy}: Numerical computations and array operations
    \item \textbf{rawpy}: RAW image file processing
    \item \textbf{NiceGUI}: Web-based user interface framework
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development Environment}
The development environment integrates tools and configurations to support efficient and organized software development. Git is utilized for version control, enabling tracking of code changes. The primary platform for development is Linux, providing a robust and versatile foundation. Python virtual environments are employed to isolate dependencies. Additionally, an automated testing framework is incorporated to streamline testing, validate functionality, and maintain code quality.

\section{Implementation of System Components}

\subsection{Camera Control System}
The implementation of the camera control system is encapsulated within the CameraManager class, developed using the gphoto2 Python library. The CameraManager begins by initializing the camera context and establishing a connection using thread-safe locks. It ensures robust operation by continuously monitoring the camera's connection status and managing reinitialization when required.

Key features of the CameraManager include the ability to list all available camera properties through a recursive exploration of the camera's configuration widgets. It allows dynamic adjustments to parameters like aperture, ISO, shutter speed, and exposure modes.

The class also provides a mechanism for extracting metadata from images, leveraging EXIF data to gather information such as focal length, lens type, and exposure settings.

The image capture functionality includes autofocus handling and respect for existing camera settings. The captured images, along with their associated metadata, are stored systematically, facilitating subsequent analysis.

Error handling is a critical aspect of the camera control system. It manages hardware exceptions and unexpected states, such as camera unavailability, by logging detailed error messages and retrying operations where appropriate.

\subsection{Image Processing Pipeline}
The image processing pipeline processes calibration images to extract relevant optical properties of camera lenses, including sharpness, vignetting, distortion, chromatic aberrations, and bokeh.

\subsubsection{Image Preprocessing and Segmentation}

The implementation begins with an initial segmentation phase, which identifies calibration elements within the image. Using algorithms such as SIFT, the pipeline detects and localizes key graphical features of the test charts. This step establishes a foundation for subsequent stages by eliminating irrelevant areas of the image.

The next step is preprocessing, where a series of transformations is applied to normalize the data. Preprocessing tasks include noise reduction, image resizing, and contrast adjustment to account for variations in lighting and camera settings. The use of median or Gaussian filters ensures that these transformations preserve critical details. The pipeline also converts raw image data to an analyzable format.

\subsubsection{Feature Detection and Analysis}

The next stage evaluates specific lens properties. For sharpness, edge detection techniques are applied, enabling the analysis of transitions between high-contrast regions. The modulation transfer function (MTF) is calculated to quantify spatial resolution, providing a robust measure of lens clarity. Vignetting is assessed by analyzing the intensity distribution across the image, while geometric distortion is evaluated by comparing expected grid patterns to their actual appearance. Chromatic aberrations are quantified by measuring color fringing at the boundaries of high-contrast features, and bokeh quality is examined through the characterization of out-of-focus light regions.

A key characteristic of the pipeline is its adaptability to various calibration test charts and environmental conditions. This is achieved through parameterized algorithms and automated calibration routines. The pipeline also integrates mechanisms to validate the reliability of the extracted data, detecting and discarding outliers that might result from erroneous inputs.

The processed data is formatted for visualization and reporting. Analytical results are structured into metrics and graphs. The results are also stored for future reference.

\subsection{User Interface Components}
The applicationâ€™s user interface provides tools for camera control, dataset management, and lens analysis. Users can connect cameras, adjust settings, capture images, and manage batch processes with real-time progress updates. Analysis tools display metrics and visualizations for sharpness, vignetting, distortion, chromatic aberrations, and bokeh. The UI also includes logging, notifications, and metadata visualization.

\subsubsection{Camera Control Panel}
The camera control panel offers a centralized interface for managing camera operations. Users can connect and disconnect the camera and monitor its status in real-time. Advanced camera controls include access to settings like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. The application supports both automatic and manual focus adjustments, ensuring flexibility for various testing scenarios. Additional features include capturing images directly through the interface, importing RAW files, and listing all camera properties.

\label{fig:ui_scenario_result}
\end{figure}

The Numerical Scores section delivers a quantitative assessment tailored to the specific scenario. For example, in sharpness analysis, this may include metrics like Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) scores. These scores are often normalized to a scale (e.g., 0-100) to simplify interpretation and enable comparisons across different lenses and settings.

The Visual Outputs section includes graphical representations to enhance the understanding of the analysis results. This may involve the display of the original captured image alongside processed visualizations, such as heatmaps, intensity maps and edge overlays.

The Measurement Details section provides more granular insights. This could include corner measurements for luminance ratios in vignetting analysis or edge intensity values for sharpness.

Finally, the Analysis Interpretation section summarizes the findings in plain language, offering a qualitative assessment of the results. For example, it may indicate whether vignetting is minimal, sharpness is excellent, or distortions are significant. This summary helps users quickly grasp the outcome of the analysis without needing to interpret the raw data or metrics.

\subsubsection{Analysis Details}

The section with visual outputs and measurement details varies based on the selected analysis type:

\textbf{Vignetting} analysis results include center-to-corner luminance ratios, average corner intensity and a normalized vignetting score. Heatmaps visually represent brightness variations across the image and offer further insights into the vignetting effect.

\caption{Sharpness analysis details.}
\label{fig:ui_sharpness_image}
\end{figure}

For \textbf{distortion} analysis, the system outputs metrics such as deviations in line straightness, average line deviation, and an overall distortion score. Grid overlays on the original image demonstrate detected distortion patterns, while corrected and uncorrected versions are displayed for comparison. The type of distortionâ€”barrel, pincushion, or waveformâ€”is identified based on the analysis.

\textbf{Chromatic aberration} analysis highlights color fringing in images, providing metrics on pixel offsets and scores for lateral and longitudinal aberrations. The UI displays zoomed-in sections of the image where chromatic aberrations occur, with overlaid color error vectors for visualization. Original and corrected images are presented side by side to showcase the impact of corrections.

In \textbf{bokeh} analysis, the system evaluates characteristics such as roundness, smoothness, and consistency of out-of-focus highlights. Overlays highlight bokeh regions, accompanied by metrics for size, shape, and edge definition. Users can compare bokeh characteristics across different aperture settings or light sources using dynamic visualization tools.

    \item \textbf{UI State Storage}: The application stores user interface state, including user preferences and the currently opened elements, between visits, ensuring a seamless user experience.
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing}

To ensure the reliability and correctness of the application, particularly in the context of the "garage lab" approach described in the methodology, a comprehensive test suite was implemented using the pytest framework. The tests were designed to validate both the technical functionality and the practical usability of the application.

\subsection{Test Architecture}
The test suite is organized into four main components, reflecting the modular architecture of the application:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{test\_camera\_manager.py} - Validates camera control and image acquisition
    \item \texttt{test\_dataset\_manager.py} - Ensures proper data organization and persistence
    \item \texttt{test\_analysis.py} - Verifies image processing and lens measurement algorithms
    \item \texttt{test\_ui.py} - Tests user interface components and interactions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Camera Manager Tests}
The camera manager tests focus on ensuring reliable camera operation in various scenarios. They evaluate the initialization process and connection management, verify the accuracy and consistency of image capture and metadata extraction, and test the configuration of the camera for different testing scenarios. Additionally, these tests validate the processing of EXIF data to extract detailed lens information and assess the effectiveness of error handling and recovery mechanisms.

\subsection{Dataset Manager Tests}

Additionally, they test the export and import capabilities to confirm that datasets are correctly archived and restored with all metadata and content.

\subsection{Analysis Tests}
The analysis tests validate various functionalities of the lens measurement algorithms, ensuring accurate evaluation of lens properties. The tests cover sharpness analysis, distortion measurement, vignetting detection, chromatic aberration evaluation, and bokeh analysis. They validate methods for detecting edges, calculating modulation transfer functions (MTF), analyzing visual artifacts, and generating visualizations. Additionally, preprocessing of RAW images, feature extraction, and score calculation for lens performance are tested..

\subsection{UI Tests}
The UI tests focus on ensuring the functionality, responsiveness, and reliability of the user interface in managing camera operations, datasets, and scenarios. These tests validate the integration of UI components with backend functionality, covering critical workflows such as camera connection, configuration, photo capture, and metadata visualization. They evaluate the behavior of UI elements like buttons, dialogs, and status indicators under different conditions, including error states. Additionally, the tests verify that key user actions (such as dataset and scenario creation, RAW file import, and analysis result display) operate seamlessly. Mocked components are used to simulate interactions, ensuring the interface handles real-world scenarios and unexpected events effectively.

\subsection{Test Fixtures and Mocking}

    \item Potential consistency issues between client and server
    \item Additional complexity in handling multi-user scenarios
    \item More complicated error recovery
    \item Need for conflict resolution in metadata
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Considerations}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Centralized} & \textbf{Split Management} \\
\hline

Network Usage & Higher for metadata operations, consistent for RAW files & Lower for metadata, same for RAW files \\
\hline
Scalability & Limited by server resources & Better distribution of computational load \\
\hline
Implementation Complexity & Lower, straightforward Python implementation & Higher, requires browser-server synchronization \\
\hline
Error Handling & Simpler recovery from failures & More complex state management required \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Technical Comparison of Dataset Management Approaches}
\label{table:dataset_comparison}
\end{table}

\subsection{Selected Approach}

For this implementation, the centralized server-side management approach was selected for several key reasons:

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Considerations}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Direct Integration} & \textbf{REST API} \\
\hline
Performance & Minimal latency, direct memory access & Network-dependent latency \\
\hline
Deployment & Requires library installation & Container-friendly, portable \\
\hline
Security & System-level permissions & Network security required \\
\hline
Scalability & Limited to local connections & Supports distributed systems \\
\hline
Error Handling & Direct exception propagation & HTTP status codes and messages \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Technical Comparison of Camera Control Approaches}
\label{table:camera_control_comparison}
\end{table}

\subsection{Implementation Impact}

The choice of approach significantly impacts the implementation:

\subsubsection{Direct Integration Implementation}
\begin{verbatim}
def capture_image(self):
    try:
        file_path = self.camera.capture(gp.GP_CAPTURE_IMAGE)
        camera_file = self.camera.file_get(
            file_path.folder, 
            file_path.name, 
            gp.GP_FILE_TYPE_NORMAL
        )
        return camera_file
    except gp.GPhoto2Error as e:
        logging.error(f"Capture failed: {e}")
        raise
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{REST API Implementation}
\begin{verbatim}
@app.post("/api/camera/capture")
async def capture_image():
    try:
        response = await client.post(
            f"{CAMERA_SERVICE_URL}/capture",
            headers={"Authorization": AUTH_TOKEN}
        )
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        raise HTTPException(status_code=response.status_code)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Selected Approach}

The direct gphoto2 integration approach was selected for several key reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance Priority}: The application requires minimal latency for precise timing of captures and settings changes.
    \item \textbf{Real-time Events}: Direct access to camera events is crucial for monitoring camera status and capture completion.
    \item \textbf{RAW File Handling}: Large RAW files are handled more efficiently with direct memory access.
    \item \textbf{Error Control}: Direct exception handling provides better control over camera-related errors.
    \item \textbf{Feature Access}: Full access to camera features without API abstraction limitations.
\end{itemize}

While REST API-based control offers advantages in terms of scalability and system integration, the performance and control requirements of lens testing necessitated the direct integration approach. The tight coupling to gphoto2 is mitigated through careful abstraction in the \texttt{CameraManager} class, allowing for potential future adaptation if requirements change.

\subsection{Future Considerations}
