\chapter{Conclusion and Further Work}
\section{Summary of Findings}
This thesis presented the development of a Python application for evaluating lens properties. The application successfully captured and analyzed images to assess various lens properties, providing a comprehensive score for each lens. Comparison with existing tools demonstrated the application's accuracy and usability.

\section{Limitations}
Limitations of the current implementation include the need for consistent lighting conditions and the dependency on specific camera models. Future work could address these limitations by developing more robust algorithms and expanding compatibility.

\section{Future Work}
Future research could focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Motorisation}: Automating the testing setup for more precise measurements.
    \item \textbf{Exhaustive Catalogue}: Developing an exhaustive catalogue of lens evaluations to serve as a reference for photographers and technicians.
\end{itemize}
